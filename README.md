The SCD41 from Sensirion is a high quality Photoacoustic based CO₂ sensor capable of detecting 0 to 40000ppm with high accuracy over 400-5000ppm ±(40ppm+5%). In order to improve accuracy the SCD41 has integrated temperature and humidity sensing built-in. For additional accuracy the SCD41 also accepts ambient pressure readings!

Note: The SCD41 has an automatic self-calibration routine. Sensirion recommends 7 days of continuous readings with at least 1 hour a day of 'fresh air' for self-calibration to complete.
